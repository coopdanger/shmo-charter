Stay Home Meet Online (SHMO) Working Group
Draft Charter

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the IETF's typical schedule of three in-person meetings per year. It has caused the IETF to have to convert previously scheduled in-person meetings into fully online meetings. Although it is the first time the IETF's meeting schedule has been disrupted, it is possible that other crises could cause similar disruptions in the future. Even in the absence of the pandemic, discussions about the possibility of fully online meetings had been occurring in the IETF community for years as a result of general increases in remote attendance, improvements in web conferencing services, concerns about the environmental impact of travel, and other reasons. 

The meeting planning activities that the IESG and the IETF LLC engage in would benefit from IETF community consensus guidance concerning novel aspects raised by these developments. The SHMO working group is therefore chartered to provide high-level guidance to the IESG and the IETF LLC concerning the following:

- Criteria for determining when a previously scheduled in-person meeting should be canceled and replaced with a fully online meeting. Similar to how RFC 8718 establishes community guidance for the selection of meeting venues, the IESG and the LLC would benefit from community consensus guidelines about which factors to consider when deciding to cancel or replace an in-person meeting and the relative importance of those factors. This work item is expected to be fulfilled with the publication of a BCP.

- Meeting planning in the event that a previously scheduled in-person meeting needs to be canceled and replaced with a fully online meeting. Similar to how RFC 8719 establishes guidance for the regional rotation of in-person meetings, the IESG and the LLC would benefit from having community consensus guidelines about the time zone selection, meeting length in days, and other high-level scheduling aspects when an in-person meeting must be cancelled. This work item is expected to be fulfilled with the publication of one or more BCPs.

- Technology functionality requirements for the technologies the IETF uses to support fully online meetings. This work item is expected to be fulfilled with one or more informational RFCs.

- What principles need to be considered when determining the meeting fee for fully online meetings. Since remote participation in in-person meetings has historically been at zero cost to participants, LLC and IESG decisions about meeting fees for fully online meetings need to be informed by community consensus guidelines about whether and how to set a registration fee for fully online meetings. This work item is expected to be fulfilled with the publication of one or more informational RFCs. Suggestions for changing the IETF's overall funding model are out of scope.

- The cadence of meeting scheduling and the mix of in-person versus fully online meetings going forward once the disruptions caused by the pandemic have subsided. The working group is expected to document the expected future meeting cadence as a BCP if consensus emerges to depart from the existing cadence of three in-person meetings per year. Notably, any such guidance will not become actionable until 3-4 years after it achieves consensus, given the length of the IETF meeting planning cycle. The working group will not progress this work item until it has requested publication for all of its meeting cancellation-related work items.

The work of SHMO is expected to produce high-level principles, not detailed operational plans. Specifications of details concerning cancellation criteria, meeting technologies, and online meeting agenda formats and content are out of scope. Aside from the fourth work item above, discussion of financial aspects of IETF meetings is out of scope. The goal is to produce guidelines for the IESG and the IETF LLC to operationalize while ensuring they have substantial flexibility to continue to deliver and evolve the IETF meeting experience to best serve IETF participants and the Internet community at large. 

The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have been mitigated by the time this group completes its work, but the experience of handling meeting planning during the pandemic has proven that having community consensus guidance at hand when dealing with novel conditions in the future would be beneficial.
